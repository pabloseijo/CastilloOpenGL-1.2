# 🏰 OpenGL 1.2 Castle Project

This project involves creating a 3D castle using the OpenGL 1.2 graphics library. The castle will feature textures, lighting, and other visual effects to create an impressive visual experience.

## 📋 Requirements

- 🌟 OpenGL 1.2
- 💻 C++11 or higher
- 🎨 An OpenGL-compatible graphics card
- 📚 A texture loading library, such as SOIL or FreeImage

## 🌈 Features

The project will include the following features:

- 🏰 A 3D castle with towers, walls, and gates.
- 🎨 High-quality textures for walls, doors, windows, and other castle details.
- 💡 Ambient and point lighting to add depth and realism to the scene.
- 🌗 Dynamic shadows to simulate the interaction of light with objects in the castle.

## 🚀 Usage

To run the project, simply compile the source code using a compiler compatible with C++11 or higher and execute the resulting file. Make sure you have the OpenGL and texture loading libraries installed and correctly configured.

## 🤝 Contributing

This project is open-source, and contributions are welcome. If you would like to contribute, please open an issue or a pull request in the GitHub repository.

## 👥 Credits
